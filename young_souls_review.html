                                    <p>Beat 'em up is one of the most popular sub-genres of action games. Especially, when it comes to playing co-op games, beat 'em titles are usually among the first choices. If we look back into the history of video games, some well-known video game series in the age of Sega Genesis, such as Streets of Rage and Golden Axe, were in this sub-genre. The popularity of these titles has been continuing even in the 9th generation. Recently, the titles such as Streets of Rage 4 and River City Girls breathed new life into this genre by introducing new gameplay mechanisms. However, none of them are more revolutionary than the new game of 1P2P studio, Young Souls.</p>

                                    <p>Young Souls has been developed by the French game studio 1P2P and The Arcade Crew has published the game. Young Souls is now available on Steam, Google Stadia, and all consoles. Moreover, the game is available on day one on Xbox Game Pass.</p>

                                <img src="upload/young_souls/1.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid img-fullwidth">

                                <div class="pp">
                                    <p>Young Souls has two main features, differentiating it from the other games in the beat 'em up sub-genre: integrating the elements of RPG and emphasizing the story. The game allows you to level up after gaining enough XP. Furthermore, you can buy, upgrade, and equip new weapons, shields, and armors during the game. Despite other well-known beat 'em up games such as Streets of Rage, the story is very important in Young Souls. The developers have put a lot of effort into making the story interesting and engaging and even combine it with the gameplay progress. Now, the question is how much these revolutionary features have helped the game.</p>

                                    <p>The story is about a professor who has been kidnapped by villain goblins and transferred into the underground. He is forced by the goblins to create a destructive machine, which will be used to attack the toplanders (or humans). The adapted children of the professor, Jenn and Tristan, use the Moon Portals to travel to the underground and rescue their father. The king of goblins has a circle of powerful servants, who will fight the children on their way to reach the castle and find the professor.</p>

                                </div><!-- end pp -->

                                <img src="upload/young_souls/2.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid img-fullwidth">

                                <div class="pp">
                                    <p>We have seen this story many times in video games. Similar to River City Girls, the army of two kids has to fight a big army of villains. However, a big advantage of the game is the narrative design or the way the story is told. There is a sense of humor in the dialogues that thrives through the game. We can always see the funny dialogues between Jenn and Tristan and also between the goblinsâ€™ king and his servants. This helps the game a lot to escape from becoming boring, particularly in the cut scenes. However, the story also has some cons. The number of dialogues and cut scenes are huge in the beginning. Thus, the first 30 minutes of the game is spent only reading the dialogues and knowing the characters. A balanced way of storytelling and introducing gameplay mechanisms could have resulted in a much more engaging start. </p>

                                    <p>The game includes several RPG elements, which are vital for progress. You can earn XP from fighting enemies, which allows you to level up. Moreover, you can upgrade your weapons and abilities in the Goblins Market. The game gives you a wide variety of weapons to fight with. If you like to be fast, you can choose dagger-type weapons, and if you like to be strong and heavy, you can go with the hammers. It seems to me that some weapons are slightly overpowered. For example, weapons with the capability of freezing enemies make some boss fights very easy. Moreover, when you obtain a very good weapon and upgrade it to the maximum, the game cannot really persuade you to change it. For example, I got the sword from the first battle with Yarlanda and kept it until the end. It is also the case for the shoes. If you buy a good shoe that gives you a useful ability, the chance you later buy another shoe is very low. </p>

                                    <p>The quality of combat is mediocre. On one hand, the enemies are diverse. Some of them are fast with weaker attacks and the others are slower but with deadlier strikes. This diversity can be also seen in the bosses. Thus, you need to have the right strategies for different battles. On the other hand, some combat mechanisms become suffering during the game. The direction of blocks does not work quite perfectly in some critical moments. Even worse, parrying the enemy attacks becomes very difficult sometimes. It is a big problem particularly in boss fights when getting a single hit might cost your life.</p>

                                    <p>One of the big advantages of Young Souls is its artistic design. The design of the characters is beautiful and it also has helped to improve the sense of humor flowing in the story. </p>

                                    <p style="text-align:center">Young Souls is a pretty good beat 'em up game, independent of the fact whether it is played alone or in co-op mode. If you are a fan of the beat 'em up or RPG genre, you have to give it a try.</p>
