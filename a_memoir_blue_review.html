                                    <p>Sometimes there is a very thin line between movies and adventure games. In classical point-and-click adventures, puzzles play an important role. There are the main tools of developers to break the monotony of dialogues and make the game interactable. However, modern adventures, especially interactive dramas, remove the puzzles and try to create a bridge between gamers and the game by means of meaningful story choices. The first game of Cloisters Interactive studio, however, has neither puzzles nor story choices. A Memoir Blue is a short adventure game that overemphasizes its story and almost completely cleans up the game from the challenging interactive parts.</p>

                                    <p>A Memoir Blue has been developed by the Taiwanese game studio Cloisters Interactive and Annapurna Interactive has published the game. The game is now available on Steam and all consoles. Moreover, the game is available from day one on Xbox Game Pass.</p>

                                <img src="upload/a_memoir_blue/1.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid img-fullwidth">

                                <div class="pp">
                                    <p>The game tells the story of a young girl who goes through a surreal journey to see her past. It starts from her childhood and then she observes herself in the later stages of life. The success of the girl in swimming and her relationship with her mother build fundamental parts of the story. The developers take advantage of many symbols such as water and fish throughout the game to create dramatic moments.</p>

                                    <p>The gameplay mechanisms are very simple. You are always facing individual scenes with a few interactable elements. Thus, your interactions with the game are limited to moving objects, opening doors, and other similar activities. When you successfully finish a sequence of tasks, the scene changes, and the story goes forward. This loop repeats until the end of the game. Unfortunately, the main shortcoming of A Memoir Blue is the lack of meaningful interactive elements. The game could have been much better if it had some challenging puzzles in the form of mini-games. In the current situation, it is very hard to even call the entire experience a video game.</p>

                                </div><!-- end pp -->

                                <img src="upload/a_memoir_blue/2.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid img-fullwidth">

                                <div class="pp">
                                    <p>Alternatively, the developers could have totally removed the naive interactive parts and converted the game into a short animation. The gameplay not only enriches the main story, but it is often an obstacle in the way of enjoying the story. In some scenes, it becomes hard to find the right objects to click on. Hence, you have to exhaustively try different things to finally find the solution. </p>

                                    <p>The developers have chosen a minimal approach to tell the story. Thus, they have removed some details from the events and key moments. Though this minimal approach has helped to keep the game short, it has also caused some holes in the story. For example, it is not totally obvious why the girl keeps winning the gold medals if she is not happy with her life and what she is doing as a swimmer. </p>

                                    <p>A Memoir Blue has a fantastic artistic design. The mixture of the 3D and 2D animations has totally paid off. It has performed as a powerful tool to make a separation between past and current times. Moreover, the developers have done a great job in designing the environment. Particularly, the ocean scenes are very successful in conveying strong feelings.</p>

                                    <p>Music is another strong point of the game. I enjoyed the songs throughout the journey as they are in line with the story and the atmosphere.  </p>

                                    <p style="text-align:center"><strong> Verdict:</strong></p>
                                    <p style="text-align:center">A Memoir Blue walks on the edge of being an animation or a game. It could have been much better if the developers had pushed it to one of the sides. It could have been an engaging game if it had some puzzles or it could have been a beautiful short animation if it was depleted from the naive interactive parts.</p>
