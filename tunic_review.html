                                    <p>When we are talking about a video game studio, we are usually referring to a team of graphic designers, programmers, music producers, and the other individuals who are directly or indirectly helping with the development process. Although it is the case for most games, in recent years, some video games with only one single developer have been published and achieved big successes. The recent examples are Papers, Please and Return of the Obra Dinn by Lucas Pop, Undertale by Toby Fox, and Stardew Valley by Eric Barone. The development process by only one person might increase the time-to-market significantly. On the other hand, it might make the different parts of the game more consistent and finally lead to a high-quality outcome if the developer can overcome all challenges.</p>

                                    <p>TUNIC developed by Andrew Shouldice is one of those games which have been created by only one person. The game has been recently published by Finji on Xbox consoles and PC. It is also available on Xbox Game Pass from the first day of release.</p>

                                <div class="pp">
                                    <p>TUNIC is an action-adventure game with an isometric camera. During the game, you move between various zones on a big map, and in some cases, you have to visit some places several times. Thus, TUNIC obviously has some Metroidvania elements.</p>

                                    <p>TUNIC puts you in the role of a little fox who wakes up in a mysterious land with a lot of dangers. You don’t know anything about this land at first. You are not aware of the little fox’s story and its connection with the environment. Moreover, you don’t know about the gameplay mechanisms and your character’s powers. When you search this land, you will find some pieces of paper, which eventually create an instruction manual. You will get information about the history of the places and your character by finding the pages. You will also get familiar with the gameplay mechanisms and the powers. All in all, the presence of this instruction manual makes the whole story and the gameplay a secret that you should reveal step by step through your journey.</p>

                                </div><!-- end pp -->

                                <img src="upload/tunic/2.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid img-fullwidth">

                                <div class="pp">
                                    <p>The gameplay is at the same time both simple and challenging. When the game starts, your only weapon is a wooden steak. But when you go further, you will find better and better weapons, which are essential to counter the enemies. In most parts of the game, you take advantage of melee attacks, blocks, and throwing bombs to wipe out the foes. Though at the first glance it seems simplistic, the correct way of using your weapons is the key to survival in the different parts of the map. Thus, the fights have enough depth to keep the gamer engaged until the end. </p>

                                    <p>The boss fights are among the best parts of the game. It is almost impossible to beat a boss in the first few tries. Each boss has several attack phases, which change based on the health bar. You have to learn each phase correctly and find the right way to damage the boss and evade the attacks. The bosses are visually different and they match the environment in which you face them. </p>
                                </div><!-- end pp -->

                                <div class="pp">
                                    <p>As I mentioned, everything in the game, from story to gameplay mechanisms, is a mystery. It makes the storytelling very interesting and unique. Moreover, it keeps you always excited about the mechanisms and powers which are going to be added to the game. However, it also has some downsides when it comes to the map and tasks. At some points, it becomes very hard to find the next steps in the game. There are basically no written tasks that you can follow. Thus, if you cannot find the right page of the instruction manual or you cannot decode it, you have to start wandering around to find the passages and the items. During my playthrough, it happened to me three times. In one of the cases, I was desperately walking around for one hour to find the way to a new location.</p>

                                    <p>The artistic design of the game is very beautiful and diverse. When you move between different places, the design of the environment and the enemies changes. You can see the best designs in the Quarry, the Great Library, and the Ruined Atoll. The music in TUNIC is always impressive and its theme changes when you go from one place to another. The music also plays an important role in boss fights when after a short silence, it makes you ready for an epic battle.  </p>
