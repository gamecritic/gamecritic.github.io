                                    <p>Perhaps video games are the best medium to tell stories about cultures, nations, and mythologies. These stories are usually about the battle between the “good” and the “bad”, so developers put you in the role of a hero and send you on a difficult journey to fight with the “bad”. I cannot deny the fact that video games made me extremely interested in the Greek and Norse myths. It was a pleasure for me to read some books after playing God of War, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, and Hades and learn more about the gods and events. Skábma - Snowfall is another game that ignited my curiosity about some people who never got attention in video games. It was very interesting for me to know about the Sámi people, their beliefs, and Mythologies and I have plans to learn more about them in the future. Despite all the problems with the story, narrative design, and gameplay, I believe we need more games like Skabma.</p>

                                <div class="pp">
                                    <p>Skábma - Snowfall has been developed by Red Stage Entertainment which is a Finish studio. The game has been recently published by PID Games and Sunsoft on PC and it is now available on Steam, Epic and GOG for a price of 19.99 €.</p>

                                    <p>Skábma tells the story of a boy called Áilu who lives with his tribe in a beautiful and untouched area. The life of the tribe is connected to their reindeers and Áilu along with the other tribe members take care of them. One day, one of the reindeer flees and Áilu goes far from the tents to find him. He then sees the death of the reindeer because of an explosion. After the disaster, the disease starts to spread rapidly through the area and affects nature, animals, and people. Áilu finds a drum which becomes his main weapon to fight the disorder and bring back the balance to the environment.</p>

                                </div><!-- end pp -->

                                <img src="upload/skabma/2.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid img-fullwidth">

                                <div class="pp">
                                    <p>Without any doubt, the story is the strongest point of the game. It is simple but on the other hand, it is new and fresh. After the game, you will clearly know to some extent about the Sámi people and how important the environment is for them. The story also supports the logic behind the four powers that you acquire during your journey. A few months ago I read in an interview that one of the game’s writers is actually Sámi. I believe that the deep knowledge of the culture and life of the Sámi people has played an important role in improving the quality of the story.</p>

                                    <p>Despite the good story, the narrative design has many problems. It is very hard to feel any emotional connection with the tribe members. If we totally remove one or two of them from the story nothing will happen. Particularly the children do not have any effective role in the way that story develops. On the other hand, the reason behind some of the family members is not totally clear. Why is the father so aggressive toward Áilu? Why does he keep threatening him? Why is Áilu so eager to help the father despite the bad behavior? These are the questions to which I couldn’t find a clear answer.</p>
                                </div><!-- end pp -->

                                <img src="upload/skabma/3.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid img-fullwidth">

                                <div class="pp">
                                    <p>A big part of the gameplay in Skábma is dedicated to walking around and platforming. During the journey, you receive four powers that help you later with your progress. These powers can change the disorders and let you pass the obstacles. For example, one of the powers creates a wind that allows you to perform big jumps, and the other one creates rocks on which you can jump. The correct and precise use of these powers is the key to overcoming the challenges.</p>

                                    <p>Unfortunately, after a while, it becomes extremely frustrating to correctly use the powers. Particularly, the platforming parts are most of the time clunky and hard to handle. For example, in some parts of the game, you have to create several winds to transfer between disorders and reach the destination. However, you cannot always reach the next disorder easily. Thus, you probably need to repeat the same series of actions again and again to pass the challenge. Moreover, sometimes, using some powers is not enjoyable. For example, taking advantage of bear power to walk through the wind is not fun. It is always slow, and you can be punished if you release the power button.</p>
                                </div><!-- end pp -->

                                <img src="upload/skabma/4.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid img-fullwidth">

                                <div class="pp">
                                    <p>In addition to platforming, you also spend a lot of time walking around in the game’s world. The environment is very beautiful and you can particularly enjoy walking in the first hour of playing the game. However, after some time, these wanderings become boring and repetitive, especially when they are not in the open areas. Running in a cave without any details is not enjoyable even for a few minutes. This problem becomes even worse when you aimlessly search for the next objective. The game doesn’t give you any map or marker to find the correct path. Thus, you have to search around for a long time to figure out the right routes. In the last patch, the game shows the right path when you play the drum. I have finished the game without this update. However, I assume it solves the problem of navigation.</p>

                                    <p>The visuals of the game are outdated and not even close to the standards of the ninth generation. The character models are poor and without any details. You cannot see any emotions in the faces and movements. Moreover, the cutscenes do not have good quality and the characters do not have any action when they have a dialogue during the game.</p>
